How to debug?
1. Test incrementally(逐步的):Every well-written program is composed of small, modular components that can be tested individually. Try out everything you write as soon as possible to identify problems early and gain confidence in your components.
2. Isolate errors:An error in the output of a statement can typically be attributed to a particular modular(模块化的) component. When trying to diagnose a problem, trace the error to the smallest fragment(碎片) of code you can before trying to correct it.
3. Check your assumptions(假设):Interpreters do carry out your instructions to the letter — no more and no less. Their output is unexpected when the behavior of some code does not match what the programmer believes (or assumes) that behavior to be. Know your assumptions, then focus your debugging effort on verifying that your assumptions actually hold.
4. Consult others
